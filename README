Mini Practical Project Specification:
Create a simple Java project for the capturing of address details that uses Spring Boot and React JS.

This project has Address Component supported by 3 database tables (Address, Province and Country).
Create back-end entities and the necessary back-end logic to support the capturing (creating and updating of addresses).
Create a method that will return all the countries sorted alphabetically.
Create a method that will return all the provinces for a specific countryCode.
The system should not allow for duplicate addresses.
Address:
That contains the actual address information for multiple customers, with
the following information.
AddressId
Line1
Line2
Suburb
City
Province
PostalCode
Country
Province:
That contains a country code, province code and name (Create a
composite key on the two codes)
CountryCode
ProvinceCode
Name
Country (CountryCode as the unique index and primary key):
CountryCode
Name
User Interface:
======================
Build one screen (web page) for the capturing of the address fields.
The PostalCode field should only allow numbers and a minimum length of 3 and a maximum of 7 digits.
The Country and Province fields must be dropdown fields.
The Province dropdown list should be updated onChange of the Country.
(For example only ZA provinces when ZA is selected).
Line1, City, Province, PostalCode and Country must be required fields.
Actual Data:
===================
Countries:
ZA, South Africa,
AF, Afghanistan,
AU, Australia
Provinces:
L, Limpopo
EC, Eastern Cape
NC, Northern Cape
WC, Western Cape
KZN, Kwazulu-Natal
NW, North West
FS, Free State
GP, Gauteng
Important Notes:
1.) Please make use of Spring Framework and Spring Boot wherever possible.
2.) Make use of React JS to build the address capturing screen.
3.) Any Database of your choice can be used.
4.) You are welcome to add more table fields where you see fit to enrich the data, improve performance or improve functionality
5.) Adhere to Java standards, naming conventions and best practices that you are aware of
6.) We want to see the way you think and write code, initiative is important
7.) Please don’t send us your code, we want to perform a code review session and review your code with you

This project makes use of MySQL database and creates the 3 entities as stipulated above. I have used Lombok library on creating
entities properties. The project is created using Spring Boot and have included Swagger that gives the OPEN-API documentation

# How to view Swagger-ui
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html or just http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/

I have created unit tests with junit and Mockito library as well as Integration tests (I have tried to usee TDD but not completely)

The client is created with react js you can start it on terminal:
 npm start

 It starts a server on port 3000. http://localhost:3000

 Used junit 5 with Mockito for unit tests and integration tests. Unit Tests are created for the service and controller layer.

 Used Spring Boot Logging with Lombok for the controller and service layer.

 I created the jar file to enable docker containerization with :
$> ./mvnw package && java -jar target/customer-addressing.jar

docker image name created with: docker build -t customer-api-docker .

run with: docker run -dp 9090:8082 customer-api-docker
